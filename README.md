# ðŸ“Š Google Play Store Data Analysis using SQL

## Overview

This project involves analyzing data from the Google Play Store using MySQL to uncover key insights about app performance, user preferences, and market trends. The dataset includes details like app name, category, rating, reviews, downloads, and pricing.

## Objectives

- Identify the **top 3 most downloaded apps**
- Calculate **average rating by category**
- Determine **which country gives the lowest average rating**
- Compare **ratings between free and paid apps**
- Analyze the **most common words in 5-star reviews**
- Find **average downloads by category**
- Compute the **total downloads of all apps**

## Tools & Skills Used

- MySQL
- SQL queries with `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `JOIN`, `CASE`, `CTEs`
- Text processing using string functions
- Data cleaning and transformation

## Dataset

The dataset was sourced from a cleaned version of the Google Play Store app data. A manually created `app_price` table was added to indicate whether apps are free or paid.

## Results

The analysis provides data-driven insights that can help:
- Developers target high-performing categories
- Marketers understand user behavior
- Improve app design based on review trends

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Import the dataset into your SQL environment
3. Run the SQL queries from the `analysis.sql` file
4. View the outputs and interpret the insights
